# password generator

## Description

For this application I built a web page with a password generator, that would generate random password options based on the user's specification. 

For this project I was provided with starter code that included HTML/CSS, so all I had to do was update the Javascript file for the interactivity. 

During the process I learnt that I still have so much to improve including my logical thinking when trackling a problem. 

One thing to mention is that the project is not completed; I just wanted to update the README to give other developers context on the project. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.
